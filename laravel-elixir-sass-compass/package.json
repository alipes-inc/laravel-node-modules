  "readme": "laravel-elixir-sass-compass\n======================\n\n## Usage\nThis is a simple compass wrapper for Laravel Elixir that was ported from: [laravel-elixir-stylus](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-elixir-stylus)\n\nAdd it to your Elixir-enhanced Gulpfile, like so:\n\n```\nvar elixir = require('laravel-elixir');\n\nrequire('laravel-elixir-sass-compass');\n\nelixir(function(mix) {\n   mix.compass();\n});\n```\n\nThis will scan your `resources/assets/scss` directory for all files. Instead, if you only want to compile a single file, you may do:\n\n```\nmix.compass(\"bootstrap.scss\");\n```\n\nFinally, if you'd like to output to a different directory than the default `public/css`, then you can override this as well.\n\n```\nmix.compass(\"bootstrap.scss\", \"foo/bar/baz\");\n```\n\n## Options\n\nCompass has a lot of different options and ways you can tweak your output:\n\n```\nmix.compass(\"*\", \"foo/bar/baz\", {\n    require: ['susy'],\n    config_file: \"path/to/config.rb\",\n    style: \"nested\"\n    sass: \"resources/assets/scss\",\n    font: \"public/fonts\",\n    image: \"public/images\",\n    javascript: \"public/js\",\n    sourcemap: true,\n    comments: true,\n    relative: true,\n    http_path: false,\n    generated_images_path: false\n});\n```\n*Note: if gulp-compass has an option and it's not listed here, you can still include it in the options object and this plugin will pass it through to gulp-compass.*\n\n* `require` - if you have any modules you'd like to include, like Susy or whatever, you can add them here.\n* `config_file` - if you like to keep your compass configurations out of gulp, you can set the path to the config file and you can use that.  *Important note: if you change the Sass and CSS directories in your config.rb file you need to update them in the Gulpfile too*\n* `style` - 3 options here: \"nested\", \"compressed\" and \"expanded\".  By default in production you css will be compressed and locally it will be nested.\n* `sass` - path to Sass files\n* `font` - path to fonts directory\n* `image` - path to image directory\n* `javascript` - path to your JavaScript\n* `sourcemap` - *requires sass 3.3.0+* if true will generate a source map \n* `comments` - When true (default, non-production), this will show line comments in the generated CSS \n* `relative` - When true (default), generate relative paths from the css file to the asset\n* `http_path` - URL Prefix of all urls starting with \n* `generated_images_path` - Absolute path to images\n",
